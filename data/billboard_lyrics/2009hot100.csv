""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you, but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said... ""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you, and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""
