If you had one chance So airplane, airplane Sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

So can I get a wish to end the politics And get back to the music that started this shit? So here I stand and then again I say I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now I could really use a wish right now I-I-I could really use a wish right now Like, like, like shooting stars I-I-I could really use a wish right now A wish, a wish right now, right now"

90@91@The House That Built Me@Miranda Lambert@ I just had to come back one last time. Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam. But these handprints on the front steps are mine. And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar. And I bet you didn't know under that live oak My favorite dog is buried in the yard. I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing. Out here it's like I'm someone else, I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could just come in I swear I'll leave. Won't take nothing but a memory From the house that built me. Mama cut out pictures of houses for years. From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines. Plans were drawn, concrete poured, And nail by nail and board by board Daddy gave life to mama's dream. I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing. Out here it's like I'm someone else, I thought that maybe I could find myself. If I could just come in I swear I'll leave. Won't take nothing but a memory From the house that built me. You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can. I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am. I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing. Out here it's like I'm someone else, I thought that maybe I could find myself. If I could walk around I swear I'll leave. Won't take nothing but a memory From the house that built me.
