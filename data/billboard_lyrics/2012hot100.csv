0@0@1@2012@Somebody That I Used To Know@Gotye Featuring Kimbra@ February 07, 2013Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I'd done But I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody Now you're just somebody that I used to know Somebody I used to know Somebody Now you're just somebody that I used to know I used to know That I used to know I used to know Somebody@2010

Every note just wrapped around his soul, From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll. Oh, I can hear 'em playin'. I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar. Oh, I can hear 'em singin', ""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."" Downtown is where I used to wander. Old enough to get there but too young to get inside. So I would stand out on the sidewalk, Listen to the music playin' every Friday night. Oh, I can hear 'em playin'. I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar. Oh, I can hear 'em singin', ""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."" Some dreams stay with you forever, Drag you around but bring you back to where you were. Some dreams keep on gettin' better, Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure. Oh, I can hear 'em playin'. I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar. Oh, I can hear 'em singin', ""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."" ""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."" Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.
