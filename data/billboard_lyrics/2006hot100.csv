And this is where I grew up I think the present owner fixed it up I never knew we ever went without The second floor is hard for sneakin' out And this is where I went to school Most of the time had better things to do Criminal record says I broke in twice I must've done it half a dozen times I wonder if it's too late Should I go back and try to graduate? Life's better now than it was back then If I was them, I wouldn't let me in Oh oh oh Oh God I, I Every memory of looking out the back door I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor It's hard to say it Time to say it Goodbye, goodbye Every memory of walking out the front door I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for It's hard to say it Time to say it Goodbye, goodbye Goodbye Remember the old arcade Blew every dollar that we ever made The cops hated us hangin' out They say somebody went and burned it down We used to listen to the radio And sing along with every song we'd know We said someday we'd find out how it feels To sing to more than just the steering wheel Kim's the first girl I kissed I was so nervous that I nearly missed She's had a couple of kids since then I haven't seen her since God knows when Oh oh oh Oh God I, I Every memory of looking out the back door I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor It's hard to say it Time to say it Goodbye, goodbye Every memory of walking out the front door I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for It's hard to say it Time to say it Goodbye, goodbye I miss that town I miss their faces You can't erase You can't replace it I miss it now I can't believe it So hard to stay Too hard to leave it If I could relive those days I know the one thing that would never change Every memory of looking out the back door I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor It's hard to say it Time to say it Goodbye, goodbye Every memory of walking out the front door I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for It's hard to say it It's time to say it Goodbye, goodbye Look at this photograph Every time I do it makes me laugh Every time I do it makes me@2000

I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too. You know I love ya! Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure. See ya. Bye, bye! I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again? And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made And like a baby boy, I neverman Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away"" Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?"" Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you For you For you For you If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?

What happens when you become the main source of a pain? ""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane ""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?"" I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain Just smile back I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing ""You're making mommy cry, why?

""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' ""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'. That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin. I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone."" But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice. Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."" That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to say And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain Just smile back"@2000
