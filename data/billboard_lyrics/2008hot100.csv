Long live the king!"" One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world"

Askin' God if he Could play it again I was walking up the front porch steps After everything that day Had gone all wrong had been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway, well on my way To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice all the roses And the note that said: Our song is the slammin' screen doors Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"" And when I got home For I said, ""Hey, man!"" Askin' God if he Could play it again I've heard every hour and listened to the radio Waited for something to come along That was as good as our song 'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window When we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'Cause it's late and his mama don't know Our song is the way he laughs The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"" And when I got home For I said, ""Hey, man!""
