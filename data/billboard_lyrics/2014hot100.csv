Driver, roll up the partition fast; Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash... Handprints and footprints on my glass, Handprints and good grips all on my ass... Private show, with the music blasting; He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty... Red wine drip, filth, talk that trash; Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash... Whoa there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur; Whoa baby, baby, be sweatin' out my hair... Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up, And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...
