99@100@The Fighter@Keith Urban Featuring Carrie Underwood@ Made you scared of love, too scared to love He didn't deserve you 'Cause you're precious heart is a precious He didn't know what he had and I thank God And it's gonna take just a little time But you're gonna see that I was born to love you What if I fall I won't let you fall What if I cry I'll never make you cry And if I get scared? I'll hold you tighter When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter What if I fall I won't let you fall What if I cry I promise I'll never make you cry And if I get scared? I'll hold you tighter When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter Look in the mirror You're beautiful, so beautiful I'm here to remind you You're my only one, let me be the one To heal all the pain that he put you through It's a love like you never knew Just let me show you What if I fall I won't let you fall What if I cry I'll never make you cry And if I get scared? I'll hold you tighter When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter What if I fall I won't let you call What if I cry I promise, I'll never make you cry And if I get scared? I'll hold you tighter When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter I wanna believe that you got me baby I swear I do from now until the next life I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart What if I fall I won't let you fall What if I cry I'll never make you cry And if I get scared? I'll hold you tighter When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter What if I fall I won't let you call What if I cry I'll never make you cry And if I get scared? I'll hold you tighter When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter What if I fall What if I cry And if I get scared?
