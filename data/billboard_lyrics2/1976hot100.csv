68@68@69@1976@Evil Woman@Electric Light Orchestra@But them broken dreams have got to end Hey, woman, you got the blues 'Cause you ain't got no one else to use There's an open road that leads nowhere, So just make some miles between here and there There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in You took my body and played to win Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame But you ain't got nobody else to blame. Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman, Evil woman. Rolled in from another town Hit some gold, too hot to settle down But a fool and his money soon go separate ways And you found a fool lyin' in a daze Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do? You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you It's so good that you're feelin' pain But you better get your face on board the very next train. Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman, (You're an evil woman) evil woman. Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman, (You're an evil woman) evil woman. Evil woman, how you done me wrong But now you're tryin' to wail a different song Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up, You made the wine, now you drink a cup I came runnin' every time you cried Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes Ha, ha, very nice to know That you ain't got no place left to go. Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman, (You're an evil woman) evil woman Evil woman, evil woman, (You're an evil woman) evil woman (Such an evil woman) evil woman Evil woman (you're an evil woman) Evil woman (such an evil woman) Evil woman...@1970
