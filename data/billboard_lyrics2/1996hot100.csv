3@3@4@1996@Nobody Knows@Tony Rich Project@ Maybe she'd be here right now. But instead... I pretended I'm glad you went away These four walls closin' more every day And I'm dying inside And nobody knows it but me Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows And I'm crying inside And nobody knows it but me Why didn't I say the things I needed to say? How could I let my angel get away? Now my world is just a tumblin' down I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around The nights are lonely, the days are so sad And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had And I'm missin' you And nobody knows it but me I carry a smile when I'm broken in two And I'm nobody without someone like you I'm tremblin' inside And nobody knows it but me I lie awake it's a quarter past three I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me Yeah my heart is callin' you And nobody knows it but me How blue can I get? You could ask my heart But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart A million words couldn't say just how I feel A million years from now you know, I'll be lovin' you still The nights are lonely, the days are so sad And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had And I'm missin' you And nobody knows it but me Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go I'm gonna unload my heart And hope you come back to me Said when the nights are lonely... The nights are lonely, the days are so sad And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had And I'm missin' you And nobody knows it but me@1990

While you got the oppurtunity. To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E. Only the strong survive. Only the wise excel. Once said by my born-in-hell. Only the lonely die slowly. Left all alone try to control me. Easy does it never ask how was it. Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets. Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute. To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot. But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it. Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it. It's natural. Never be ashamed.

92@92@93@1996@Hay@Crucial Conflict@ Thangs is feelin' good today. I'm tore up, from the floor up Sippin on some crown royal. Trippin', in a circle of wood Where everybody smoke they own bud. Good ole' hay How you feel today? Fine, blowed and dandy. Silly like I'm hype off candy. Gotta big, thick chic named sandy. In the farm in the middle of the barn Where everybody's feelin' crazy. I went to visit granny's house. Now I see why don't nobody leave. We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin' b's. Too blitzed to even shake it off But I still got my head up. Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn And get my big black peter sucked Pass the hay you silly slut, Blaze it up so I can hit that bud. Git me zoned and I'll be on. 'Cause I love to smoke upon hay. Smokin' on Hay in the middle of the barn. Smokin' on Hay in the middle of the barn. The hay got me goin' through a stage And I just can't get enough. Smokin' everyday I got some hay And you know I'm finna roll it up. Make a cloud I'm gonna take my mind away from all the Bullcrap. Bump my sounds Lay back and roll Mack to the freaks that's on the road. Sometimes I wonder When I was blowed on the streets. Anybody wanna step to me, I'ma see how rough they be. In this session, manifesting On myp's and q's Never snooze 'cause I refuse. Inhale, exhale the smell. Smokin' hay all by myself. Wildstle, laughin' loud. Wit my homies by my side. If somethin' jump off let it ride On my square when time is live. Everybody throw it up Go to the barn and get some hay. When I get my choke on. Fool you know I'm smokin' on... Hay now hay We smokin' up hay in the middle of the barn And I'm lit up Can't get up My eyes are red And my head is spinnin. Took another pull Ridin' red bull Got the goofies, can't stop grinnin. Got a posse full of hoes playin' in my braids And we bout to get in em. Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at And everything funny. Gotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high Smokin' all that hay with no money. Now truly this bitch wanna do me So I hit the 151bacardi She high like the sun Thick like cornbread, and I'm ready to party. That hay got me so gotdamn horny But I don't like that tramp. The only reason I'm poppin' that coochie Cause the hoe had a book of foodstamps. And I got the munchies I need soul food. Collard greens or pinto beans. If you smoke hay like the conflict do, Then you know what the hell I mean. Rollin' down the block Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack. Got my niggas in the barn smokin' on that Hay stack Back up on the scene from smokin' herb, I creeped up on the wall and all I heard. Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in The hay With a funky dime word. Couldn't be myself Couldn't smoke wit nobody else If I didn't pass it to the left. Nigga would have lost my breath. Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint But I can't 'Cause I roll around in dat barn ride. Rollin' up the hootie hoo Roughest skin roller on dat west side. Nigga come on in I got some hay Won't you close dat barn door Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor. Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn The flies keep us chokin. Thank you Jesus Christ For all the hay you're givin' us 'Cause we'll keep on smokin'.@1990

99@99@100@1996@Don't Cry@Seal@ Those tears are for someone else. I hear your voice on the phone. I hear you feel so alone. My baby. Oh my baby. Please my baby, My baby, When we were young, And truth was paramount. We were older then, And we lived a life without any doubt. Those memories, They seem so long ago. What's become of them? When you feel like me I want you to know. ...They've all gone for sure... Don't cry. Not alone. Don't cry, Tonight, my baby. Don't cry, You'll always be loved. Don't cry, Tonight. My baby. Today I dreamed, Of friends I had before. And I wonder why. The ones who care don't call anymore. My feelings hurt. But you know I overcome the pain. And I'm stronger now, There can't be a fire unless there's a flame. Don't cry. Your not alone. Don't cry, Tonight, my baby. Don't cry. You'll always be loved. Don't cry oh... Limousines and sycophants, Don't leave me now, 'Cause I'm afraid what you've done to me. Is now the wolf. In my bed, In my head. In my head. In my head. The challenges, we took were hard enough. They get harder now. Even when we think that we've had enough. Don't feel alone, 'Cause it's I who understands, I'm your sedative, Take a piece of me whenever you can. Don't cry... you're not alone. ...Don't be so hard on yourself... Don't cry... tonight my baby ...These tears are for... someone else... Don't cry... you'll always be loved ...I hear your voice on the phone... Don't cry... tonight sweet baby ...I hear you fear... so alone. Don't cry... don't cry... don't cry... don't you cry... ...My baby Cry... Don't cry... 'Cause you still be loved Don't cry Don't cry tonight Oh... My baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby ...Ba da ba ba da da... My baby my baby my my baby my baby my baby my baby mymy baby my baby my baby ...Oh... yeyeyeyeiah... yeyeyeyeiah... My baby... You'll still be loved by me@1990
