All this time the river flowed Endlessly  like a silent tear All this time the river flowed Father, if Jesus exists Then how come he never lived here? The teachers told us The Romans built this place They built a wall and a temple And an edge of the empire Garrison town They lived and they died, they prayed to their gods But the stone gods did not make a sound And their empire crumbled till all that was left Were the stones the workmen found All this time the river flowed In the falling light of a northern sun If I had my way, I'd take a boat from the river Men go crazy in congregations They only get better one by one One by one One by one by one One by one I looked out across the river today Saw a city in the fog and an old church tower Where the seagulls play"@1990
