90@90@91@1992@That's What Love Is For@Amy Grant@We'll take a perfect night And fill it up with words we don't mean Dark sides best unseen And we wonder why we're feeling this way. Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same Why we can be unkind Questioning the strongest of hearts That's when we must start Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far. That's what love is for To help us through it That's what love is for Nothing else can do it. Melt our defenses Bring us back to our senses Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for. Sometimes I see you And you don't know I am there And I'm washed away by emotions I hold deep down inside Getting stronger with time It's living through the fire And holding on we find Believing in the one thing That has gotten us this far That's what love is for To help us through it That's what love is for Nothing else can do it. Round off the edges Talk us down from the ledges Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for That's what love is for. That's what love is for Melt our defenses Bring us back to our senses Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for. That's what love is for. That's what love is for.
