10@10@11@1998@How's It Going To Be@Third Eye Blind@Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for, When I say out loud, I want to get out of this I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss? I wonder How it's going to be, when you don't know me How's it going to be, when you're sure I'm not there? How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to Between you and me? 'Cause I don't care How's it going to be? How's it going to be? Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match, Sharp as a thumbnail scratch, A silence I can't ignore, Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in, Swings empty, I don't see lightning like last fall When it was always about to hit me I wonder How's it going to be, when it goes down? How's it going to be, when you're not around? How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing Between you and me? 'Cause I don't care How's it going to be How's it going to be, When you don't know me, any more? And how's it going to be Want to get myself back in again, The soft dive of oblivion I want to taste the salt on your skin The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion How's it going to be, When you don't know me, anymore?

Boy, this evening, was it only me Feeling completely down to be open Down to be open for some satisfaction Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction I knew it was wrong for feeling this way Especially the thought of getting in on the first date Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind At the end of the night, I had to decide I was thinking. I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night We were chillin, watching your TV I thought you were coming close as you got to me Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you And somehow in one night, discover I love you Felt so right but it felt so wrong And look how we are carrying on Try to say things to get me to stay But my watch tells me it's getting too late I'm thinking. I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night You got to know me And if you want my love You gotta win my love Hey baby That's the way it's got to be, yeah Get to know me, get to know me So we can do this I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night@1990

And if the road you take leads to heartbreak, Somewhere down the line. If someone ever hurts you, Or treats your heart unkind... You just run to the arms of the one who loves you. You just run to these arms, And these two arms will keep you warm. When rain has found your heart, Never fear, I'm never far. You just run to the arms of the one who loves you. Verse Two (LaTocha): I want you happy, I want the best for you. And if you have to leave to find your dream, I hope that dream comes true. But if the world you find brings you hard times, If someone makes you cry, I'll be there to hold you, I'll be standing by. Bridge (Tamika): My love is strong enough, you know, Strong enough to let you go. But I'll always hold you, Inside my heart. And if you should ever change your mind, You can come back any time, And when you do...@1990
