Nowadays you can't be too sentimental Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental"" Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk It's still rock and roll to me Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers 'Cause it's always been the same old scene There's a new band in town But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine Aimed at your average teen How about a pair of pink sidewinders And a bright orange pair of pants? ""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby If you just give it half a chance Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers"" Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me Wooh, wooh Ooh, what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? ""Don't you know that they're out of touch?"" Should I try to be a straight A student? ""If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey? All you need are looks and a whole lotta money"" It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me"@1980
9@9@10@1980@The Rose@Bette Midler@ That drowns the tender reed Some say love, it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love, it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love, it is a flower And you, its only seed It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul, afraid of dyin' That never learns to live When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long That you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun's love In the spring becomes the rose@1980
