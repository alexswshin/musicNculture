Please understand... if love ends Then I promise you, I promise you that That I shall never breathe again (Breathe again, breathe again) That I shall never breathe again And I can't stop thinking about About the way things used to be And I can't stop thinking about About the love that you made to me And I can't get you out of my head How in the world will I begin To let you walk right out my life And blow my heart away? And I can't stop caring about About the apple of my eye And I can't stop doing without Without the center of my life And I can't get you out of my head And I know I can't pretend That I won't die if you decide You won't see me again And I can't stop thinking about About the way my life would be No, I can't stop thinking about How could you love me then leave? And I can't get you out of my mind God knows how hard I've tried And if you walk right out my life God knows I'd surely die And I can't stop doing without Without the wailing of my heart No, I can't stop doing without For I would surely fall apart And I can't get you out of my mind And I know I can't deny it And I would die if you decide You won't see me again"@1990

I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies, that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up Ooh child things are gonna get easier Ooh child things are gonna get brighter Ooh child things are gonna get easier Ooh child things are gonna get brighter Verse Two: Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two And I realize momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life, to raise me right And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems tha rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up You know it's funny when it rains and pours They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is There ain't no hope for tha future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup And even though you're fed up Huh, ya got to keep your head up Verse Three: And uh To all the ladies havin' babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em 'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week 'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me I was given this world I didn't make it And now my son's getten older and older and cold From havin' the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is drivin' Benz I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but Please... you got to keep your head up@1990
