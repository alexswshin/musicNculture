0@0@1@1972@The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face@Roberta Flack@I thought the sun rose in your eyes And the moon and the stars Were the gifts you gave To the dark and the endless skies, my love And the first time ever I kissed your mouth I felt the earth move in my hands Like the trembling heart Of a captive bird That was there at my command, my love And the first time ever I lay with you I felt your heart so close to mine And I knew our joy Would fill the earth And last till the end of time, my love The first time, ever I saw your face Your face Your face Your face@1970
1@1@2@1972@Alone Again (Naturally)@Gilbert O'Sullivan@If I'm not feeling any less sour I promise myself to treat myself And visit a nearby tower And climbing to the top Will throw myself off In an effort to make clear to whomever What it's like when you're shattered Left standing in the lurch At a church where people saying My God, that's tough, she stood him up No point in us remaining We may as well go home As I did on my own Alone again, naturally To think that only yesterday I was cheerful, bright and gay Looking forward to, well, who wouldn't do The role I was about to play But as if to knock me down Reality came around And without so much as a mere touch Cut me into little pieces Leaving me to doubt Talk about God in His mercy Who, if He really does exist Why did He desert me? And in my hour of need I truly am, indeed Alone again, naturally It seems to me that there are more hearts Broken in the world that can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do? Alone again, naturally Now, looking back over the years And whatever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand why the only man She had ever loved had been taken Leaving her to start With a heart so badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally@1970
2@2@3@1972@American Pie@Don McLean@" January 23, 2008I can still remember how that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Did you write the book of love? And do you have faith in God above? If the Bible tells you so Now, do you believe in rock and roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues Ilonely teenage bronkin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx A quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the halftime air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"" They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die"""@1970

26@26@27@1972@A Horse With No Name@America@I was looking at all the life There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The first thing I metfly with a buzz And the sky with no clouds The heat was hot and the ground was dry But the air was full of sound I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can remember your name 'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain Lalala... After two days in the desert sun My skin began to turn red After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed And the story it told of a river that flowed Made me sad to think it was dead You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can remember your name 'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain Lalala... After nine days I let the horse run free 'Cause the desert had turned to sea There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The ocean is a desert with it's life underground And a perfect disguise above Under the cities lies a heart made of ground But the humans will give no love You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can remember your name 'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain Lalala...@1970

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace. That story is true, I'm here to say I was drivin' that Model A. It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up. That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup. It's got eight cylinders; uses them all. It's got overdrive, just won't stall. With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust, With 4.11 gears you can really get lost. It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared. The brakes are good, tires fair. Pulled out of San Pedro late one night The moon and the stars was shinin' bright. We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill Passing cars like they was standing still. All of a sudden in a wink of an eye A Cadillac sedan passed us by. I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!"" By then the taillight was all you could see. Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind, So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind. Took my foot off the gas and man alive, I shoved it on down into overdrive. Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten My speedometer said that I hit top end. My foot was blue, like lead to the floor. That's all there is and there ain't no more. Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense And telephone poles looked like a picket fence. They said, ""Slow down! I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots."" Took a corner; sideswiped a truck, Crossed my fingers just for luck. My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts. The guy beside me was white as a ghost. Smoke was comin' from out of the back When I started to gain on that Cadillac. Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass. Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas? We had flames comin' from out of the side. Feel the tension. Man! What a ride! I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!"" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by. Now all of a sudden she started to knockin', And down in the dips she started to rockin'. I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln! They arrested me and they put me in jail. And called my pappy to throw my bail. And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"""@1970

84@84@85@1972@Taxi@Harry Chapin@" I needed one more fare to make my night A lady up ahead waved to flag me down She got in at the light ""Oh where you going to, my lady blue? It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain"" She just looked out the window She said, ""Sixteen Parkside Lane"" Something about her was familiar I could swear I'd seen her face before But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken"" And she didn't say anything more It took a while, but she looked in the mirror Then she glanced at the license for my name A smile seemed to come to her slowly Itsad smile, just the same And she said, ""How are you Harry?"" I said, ""How are you Sue? Through the too many miles and the too little smiles I still remember you"" It was somewhere in a fairy tale I used to take her home in my car We learned about love in the back of a Dodge The lesson hadn't gone too far You see, she was gonna be an actress And I was gonna learn to fly She took off to find the footlights I took off to find the sky Oh, I've got something inside me To drive a princess blind There's a wild man, wizard He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind Oh, I've got something inside me Not what my life's about 'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me Over 'til my time runs out Baby's so high that she's skying Yes she's flying, afraid to fall I'll tell you why baby's crying 'Cause she's dying, aren't we all There was not much more for us to talk about Whatever we had once was gone So I turned my cab into the driveway Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns And she said, ""we must get together"" But I knew it'd never be arranged And she hand me twenty dollars for a two fifty fare She said, ""Harry, keep the change"" Well another man might have been angry And another man might have been hurt But another man never would have let her go I stashed the bill in my shirt And she walked away in silence It's strange how you never know But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for Such a long, long time ago You see she was gonna be an actress And I was gonna learn to fly She took off to find the footlights I took off for the sky And here, she's acting happy Inside her handsome home And me, I'm flying in my taxi Taking tips and getting stoned I go flying so high, when I'm stoned"@1970
