1@1@2@2002@Foolish@Ashanti@But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad (Treat me so bad) You said you love me, no one above me And I was all you had (All you had) And though my heart is beatin' for ya I can't stop crying I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way And still I stay See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you Baby, I don't know why you're wanna do me wrong (Do me wrong) See, when I'm home, I'm all alone And you are always gone (Always gone) And boy, you know I really love you I can't deny I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears After all these years See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you (Ohh) I trusted you, I trusted you So sad, so sad what love will make you do All the things that we accept Be the things that we regret To all of my ladies (Ladies) Feel me, come on, sing with me See, when I get the strength to leave You always tell me that you need me And I'm weak 'cause I believe you And I'm mad because I love you So I stop and think that maybe You can learn to 'preciate me Then it all remains the same that You ain't never gonna change (Never gonna change, never gonna change) See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you See, my days are cold without you But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you And though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you Baby, why you hurt me? Leave me and desert me Boy, I gave you all my heart And all you did was tear it up Lookin' out my window Knowing that I should go Even when I pack my bags There's somethin' always hold me back@2000

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue And the heroes who died just doin' what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters? I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you The difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day? Teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin' And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love?
