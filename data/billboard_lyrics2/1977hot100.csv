He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"" And still those voices are calling from far away Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise) Bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling The pink champagne on ice And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device"" And in their masters' chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before ""Relax"", said the night man ""We are programmed to receive You can checkout any time you like But you can never leave"""@1970

I fell in love with her. She wrote her number on the back of my hand. I called her up, I was all out of breath, I said, ""Come hear me play in my rock and roll band. I took a shower and I put on my best blue jeans. I picked her up in my new VW van. She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath. I said, ""Hi"". She said, ""Yeah, I guess I am.""

I had a gig in the American Legion Hall. Itdance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corp. She was sitting in a corner against the wall. She would smile and I melted all over the floor. Ariel' I took her home with me. We watched some TV, Annette Funicello and some guy going steady. I started fooling around with the vertical hold. We got the munchies and I made some spaghetti.
