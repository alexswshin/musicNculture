This he told me Said, ""I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm Gonna join in a rock and roll band Got to get back to the land And set my soul free"" We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we've got to get ourselves Back to the garden Well, then can I walk beside you? I have come to lose the smog And I feel myself a cog In somethin' turning And maybe it's the time of year Yes, and maybe it's the time of man And I don't know who I am But life is for learning We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden By the time we got to Woodstock We were half a million strong And everywheresong And a celebration And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes Riding shotgun in the sky Turning into butterflies Above our nation We are stardust, we are golden We are caught in the devil's bargain And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden"@1970
