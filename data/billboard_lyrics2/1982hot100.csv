He must have been a gardener that cared a lot, Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. And now it all looks strange. It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain. And what's it for, This little empty garden by the brownstone door? And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more. Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot, Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. And we are so amazed! We're crippled and we're dazed A gardener like that one, no one can replace. And I've been knocking, but no one answers. And I've been knocking, most all the day. Oh and I've been calling, oh hey, hey, Johnny! Can't you come out to play? And through their tears, Some say he farmed his best in younger years. But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear. Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot, Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls We hear, we hear your name And I've been knocking, but no one answers. And I've been knocking, most all the day. Oh and I've been calling, oh hey, hey, Johnny! Can't you come out to play? And I've been knocking, but no one answers. And I've been knocking, most all the day. Oh and I've been calling, oh hey, hey, Johnny! Can't you come out, can't you come out to play? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden? Johnny?
