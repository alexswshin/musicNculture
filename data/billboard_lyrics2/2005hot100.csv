Shh, mama's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdies' neck I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad@2000
