0@0@1@1997@Candle In The Wind 1997@Elton John@ August 31, 2011May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart You called out to our country And you whispered to those in pain Now you belong to heaven And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend never will Loveliness we've lost These empty days without your smile This torch, we'll always carry For our nation's golden child And even though we try The truth brings us to tears All our words cannot express The joy you brought us through the years And it seems to me you've lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend never will Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed yourselves Where lives were torn apart Goodbye England's rose From a country lost without your soul Who'll miss the wings of your compassion More than you will ever know And it seems to me you've lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will@1990

How do I get myself back to the place where you said I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing The velvet, it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive Now I'm struggling to survive Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress One, and you hold me And we are broken Still it's all that I want to do Just a little now Feel myself hovering off the ground I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right And I want something else to get me through this life, baby I want something else, not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there In the place we used to start I want something else@1990
