2@2@3@1986@I Miss You@Klymaxx@Then I turned around to say that I loved you Then I realized That it was just my mind Playing tricks on me... It seems colder lately at night And I try to sleep with the lights on Every time the phone rings I pray to God it's you I just can't believe (just can't believe) That we're through... I miss you (I miss you...) There's no other way to say it And I, And I can't deny it. I miss you (I miss you...) It's so easy to see I miss you and me... Is it done and over this time? Can we ever change our minds? But it's our first love... All the feelings that we used to share... I refuse to believe that you don't care. I miss you (I miss you...) There's no other way to say it And I, and I can't deny it. I miss you (I miss you...) It's so easy to see I've got to gather my senses together (Together) I've been through worse kinds of weather If it's over now (over now) Be strong (be strong) I can't believe that you're gone... I've got to carry on. I miss you (I miss you...) It's driving me crazy I don't want to live without you. I miss you (I miss you...) It's so easy to see I miss you and dream.@1980

Is it East versus West, or man against man? Can any nation stand alone? In the burning heart, just about to burst There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night, rising like a spire In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire In the warrior's code, there's no surrender Though his body says stop, his spirit cries never Deep in our soul a quiet ember Knows it's you against you It's the paradox that drives us on It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack, it's the passion that kills The victory is yours alone In the burning heart, just about to burst There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night, rising like a spire In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire@1980
