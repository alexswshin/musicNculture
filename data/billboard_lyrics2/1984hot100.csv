I thought it was clear The plan was we would share, This feeling just between ourselves. But when the music changed The plan was re-arranged He went to dance with someone else. We started dancing and love put us into a groove But now he's with somebody new What does love want me to do? Love said: Let the music play He won't get away, Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play. Let the music play He won't get away, This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no. He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see He's dancing his way back to me. Guess he's discovered we are truly lovers, Magic from the very start, 'cause love just kept me groovin', And he felt me movin' even though we danced apart. So we started dancing and love put us into the groove As soon as we started to move, as soon as we started to move. Love said: Let the music play He won't get away, Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play. Let the music play He won't get away, This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no.

Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone I'll take my chances I forgot how nice romance is I haven't been there for the longest time I had second thoughts at the start I said to myself, Now I know the woman that you are You're wonderful so far And it's more than I hoped for I don't care what consequence it brings I have been a fool for lesser things I want you so bad I think you ought to know that I intend to hold you for the longest time Whoa oh oh oh (the longest) For the longest time Whoa oh oh (the longest) For the longest time Whoa oh oh (the longest) For the longest time Whoa oh oh (the longest) For the longest time Whoa oh oh (the longest) For the longest time@1980
