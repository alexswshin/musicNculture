When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, God must have spent a little more time on you. I never thought that love could feel like this, Then you changed my world with just one kiss. How can it be, that right here with me, There's an angel, it's a miracle. Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep. When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, God must have spent a little more time on you. God must have spent a little more time on you.@1990
