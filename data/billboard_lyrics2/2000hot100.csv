0@0@1@2000@Breathe@Faith Hill@Being with you gets me that way I watch the sunlight dance across your face And I've never been this swept away All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms The whole world just fades away The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart 'Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby, all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe Just breathe In a way I know my heart is waking up As all the walls come tumbling down Closer than I've ever felt before And I know, and you know There's no need for words right now 'Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby, all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe Just breathe Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe, just breathe I can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you gets me that way@2000
