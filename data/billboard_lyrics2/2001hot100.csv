All mornin' I'd been thinking my life's so hard, And they wore everything they owned, living in a car. I wanted to tell 'em it would be okay, But I just got in my Suburban and I drove away. And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. Keep having this dream about my old man, I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand. We're talking on the front porch Watching the sun go down, But it was just a dream. Heslave to his job And he couldn't be around. So many things I want to say to him, But I just placed a rose on his grave, And I talked to the wind. And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry. I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife And everything that I hold dear in my life. We say grace, and thank the Lord Got so much to be thankful for. Then its up the stairs and off to bed And my little girl says, ""I haven't had my story, yet."" And everything weighing on my mind disapears just like that When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, ""I love you, dad!"" And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
