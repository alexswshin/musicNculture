There was empires in Africa called Kush, Timbuktu, where every race came to get books To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans, Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When Gold was converted to money it all changed, Money then became empowerment for Europeans. The Persian military invaded, They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred Africa was almost robbed naked, Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships. Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces. Shot off their nose to impose what basically Still goes on today you see. If the truth is told the youth can grow. They'll learn to survive, until they gain control. Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes. Read more, learn more, change the globe.

Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G At Thug Mansion Tupac: A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times I once contemplated suicide and would have tried But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you Picture me inside the misery of poverty No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on We finally found a spot to kick it Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion' (Chorus: Anthony Hamilton) Ain't no place I'd rather be Children, dead homies and family Sky high, iced out paradise In the sky... Ain't no place I'd rather be Only place that's right for me Chromed out mansion in paradise In the sky... 2Pac: Will I survive all the fights and the darkness? Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change? Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain? I need a place to rest my head With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion 2Pac: Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke Then some lady named Billie Holiday Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, till the day came Little LaTasha sure grown Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band Just think of all the people that you knew in the past That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last Picture a place that they exist, together There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'@2000

It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers (I heard) I've come to know there's life at both ends Of that red dirt road. Her daddy didn't like me much In my shackled up GTO I'd sneak out in the middle of the night Throw rocks at her bedroom window We'd turn out the headlights And drive by the moonlight Talk about what the future might hold Down that red dirt road It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers (I heard) I've come to know there's life at both ends Of that red dirt road. I went out into the world And I came back in I lost Mary Oh, I got her back again And driving home tonight It feels like I found a long lost friend It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers (I heard) I've come to know there's life at both ends Of that red dirt road.@2000

95@95@96@2003@Like a Stone@Audioslave@ September 01, 2006 In a room full of emptiness By a freeway I confess I was lost in the pages Of a book full of death Reading how we'll die alone And if we're good we'll lay to rest Anywhere we want to go In your house I long to be Room by room patiently And I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone And on my deathbed I will pray To the gods and the angels Like a pagan to anyone Who will take me to Heaven To a place I recall I was there so long ago The sky was bruised, the wine was bled And there you led me on In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone, alone And on I read Until the day was gone And I sat in regret Of all the things I've done For all that I've blessed And all that I've wronged In dreams until my death I will wander on In your house I long to be Room by room patiently And I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone, alone@2000
96@96@97@2003@Don't know Why@Norah Jones@ I don't know why I didn't come I left you by the house of fun I don't know why I didn't come, I Don't know why I didn't come When I saw the break of day I wished that I could fly away Instead of kneeling in the sand Catching teardrops in my hand My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind forever Out across the endless sea I would die in ecstasy But I'll be a bag of bones Driving down the road alone My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind forever Something has to make you run I don't know why I didn't come I feel as empty as a drum I don't know why I didn't come, I Don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come@2000
