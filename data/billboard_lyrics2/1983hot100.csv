It's only natural Another Saturday, another date She would be ready, but she'd always make him wait In the hallway, in anticipation He didn't know the night would end up in frustration He'd end up blowing all these wages for the week All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek Come dancing That's how they did it when I was just a kid And when they said come dancing My sister always did My sister should have come in at midnight And my mom would always sit up and wait It always ended up in a big wreck When my sister used to get her late Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight Two silhouettes saying good night by the garden gate Come on! Are you gonna be out there all night? The day they knocked down the palais My sister stood and cried But then they knocked down the palais Part of my childhood died, just like... Now I'm grown up and playing in a band And there's a car park where the palais used to stand My sister's married, and she lives on an estate Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait She knows they get away with things she never could And like if I asked her, I wonder if she would Come dancing Come on, sister, have yourself a ball Don't be afraid to come dancing It's only natural Come dancing Just like the palais on a Saturday And all her friends would come dancing While the big bands used to play@1980
