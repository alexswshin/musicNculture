Now it all seems light years away And now you know I can't smile without you I can't smile without you I can't laugh and I can't sing I'm findin' it hard to do anything You see, I feel sad when you're sad I feel glad when you're glad If you only knew what I'm goin' through I just can't smile without you Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find Well I'm finding it hard leavin' your love behind me And you see I can't smile without you I can't smile without you I can't laugh and I can't sing I'm findin' it hard to do anything You see I feel glad when you're glad I feel sad when you're sad If you only knew what I'm goin' through I just can't smile without you... you... lalalala@1970

Would you laugh at me? If I said I care for you? Could you feel the same way too? I wanna know The name of the game Now the lights are going out Along the boulevard But I have no friends, no one to see And I'm never invited But now I am here, I'm ready to go Along is in the park I don't know what I'm talking to you No wonder I get excited Your smile, and the sound of your voice And the way you see through me Got a feeling, you give me no choice But it means a lot to me So I wanna know What's the name of the game?
