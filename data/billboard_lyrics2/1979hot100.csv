Telling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears. That's a strange way to tell me you love me When your sorrow is all I can see If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no Don't cry to me, no Didn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name? I heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain. And in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun. Waiting for the laughter, but the laughter never comes. That's a strange way to tell me you love me When your sorrow is all I can see If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no Don't cry to me, no Didn't you feel alone this morning, didn't you need a friend? And in your darkest hour, you came runnin' back again That's a strange way to tell me you love me That's a strange way to tell me you love me That's a strange way to tell me you love me@1970
