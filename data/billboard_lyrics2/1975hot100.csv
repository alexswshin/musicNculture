The valentines I never knew The Friday night charades of youth Were spent on one more beautiful At seventeen I learned the truth And those of us with ravaged faces Lacking in the social graces Desperately remained at home Inventing lovers on the phone Who called to say come dance with me And murmured vague obscenities It isn't all it seems At seventeen A brown eyed girl in hand me downs Whose name I never could pronounce Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve, They only get what they deserve"" The rich relationed hometown queen Marries into what she needs With a guarantee of company And haven for the elderly Remember those who win the game Lose the love they sought to gain In debentures of quality And dubious integrity Their small town eyes will gape at you In dull surprise when payment due Exceeds accounts received At seventeen To those of us who know the pain Of valentines that never came And those whose names were never called When choosing sides for basketball It was long ago and far away The world was younger than today And dreams were all they gave for free To ugly duckling girls like me We all play the game and when we dare To cheat ourselves at solitaire Inventing lovers on the phone Repenting other lives unknown That call and say, come dance with me And murmur vague obscenities At ugly girls like me At seventeen"@1970

Tell the radio goodnight All alone once more Angie baby Angie baby You're a special lady Living in a world of make believe Well, maybe Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy With evil on his mind 'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room At the night through the window blind I see your folks have gone away Would you dance with me today I'll show you how to have a good time Angie baby When he walks in her room, he feels confused Like he walked into a play And the music's so loud it spins him around Till his soul has lost its way And as she turns the volume down He's getting smaller with the sound It seems to pull him off the ground Toward the radio he's bound Never to be found The headlines read that a boy disappeared And everyone thinks he died 'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover Who keeps her satisfied It's so nice to be insane No one asks you to explain Radio by your side Angie baby Angie baby You're a special lady Living in a world of make believe Well, maybe Well, maybe Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby) (Angie baby, Angie baby)@1970
