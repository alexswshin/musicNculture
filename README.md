# musicNculture

# Description of the problem context:
There have been many efforts in music recommendations by collaborative filter approaches or the context of the music analysis. My interest started from the question of what makes the music timeless with a belief that it has to do with trending values of each time. While there has been a considerable effort in analyzing tone and rhythms which are basic ingredients in music, I would like to focus on the last ingredient lyrics, the literature of the culture.

# The objective of this project
Today's music is criticized for lack of depth yet there has been noticeable variations in the trends. Music as a form of art is considered to be the delivery vehicle to convey messages. And the popular music of each era often reflects what general public want and feel. That being said, I'd like to make an assumption that it is possible draw a dot between the insight of each time and the music, the culture's literature. In this project, I would like to discover the message throughout the culture of each time by analyzing lyrics. Each lyric will be analyzed using NLTK specifically on repetition, meaning, complexity, bad/good word, sentiment analysis over the lyrics.

# Specific questions to answer
How are the musical trends correlated with cultural trends?
What are the major messages delivered by popular musics? And how do they vary depending on musicians and genre?
What selected themes are presented and how long did they last?
What are the main messages discussed in each genre of each time?

# Additional questions to answer (temporarily not decided)
Given any song’s lyrics, how well might the song perform in selected year?
